This is nextjs project to swap tokens using Moralis.

## Setup:

Follow this article for the setup and execution - https://moralis.io/how-to-program-token-swaps-with-1inch-plugin/

## Note:
- Looks like Moralis doesn't work or support testnets hence we had to use our money to check this out.
- The token addresses and amount to be swapped are currently hard-coded, try modifying it according to the need.
